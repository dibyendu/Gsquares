 Instruction
--------------
  This game can be played in both single-player & multi-player mode. It's based
on the popular game of "Box & Dots". Game-board consists of numbers of dots aligned 
horizontally & vertically. Players take it in turn to draw lines in between any two 
non-diagonal dots. Whenever the player completes one box that box is registered to 
him/her & he/she gets another turn. The player with most boxes wins.
